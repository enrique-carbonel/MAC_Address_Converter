Code utilized to format a string of a MAC address that was wrong formatted.

The MAC Address was written as aaaa.0000.aaaa

This code what it does is that it grabs a .txt file with a bunch of MAC Addresses (each on its own separate line) and it converts it to the correct format (AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA).

WARNINGS:

 - Be careful about adding whitespace as this will affect the format of the MAC addresses
 - Only write MAC addresses and nothing else
 - Must be in the same wrong format as previously mentioned
